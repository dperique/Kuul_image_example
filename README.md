# Kuul_image_example

The repo is just build buidling a sample docker image for use in running it on
the [Kuul Periodic System](https://github.com/dperique/Kuul_periodics).

It is just a docker image so it can also be run standalone -- but that's part of
the point -- i.e., you want to be able to run it standalone so you can debug it
before adding it to a Kuul Periodic System.
